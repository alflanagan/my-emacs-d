* Project TODOs

** TODO Set up github actions to run tests
  - At a minimum, we should ensure emacs won't fail on startup. Will need to setup a config directory structure.

** TODO Create Issue Template
  - Make reporting as easy as possible, but capture required information.

** TODO Formalize contributions policy in CONTRIBUTING.md.

** DONE Adopt a Code Of Conduct
- State "DONE"       from "ON HOLD"    [2024-07-27 Sat 12:48]
  - well, aside from "don't piss me off"
